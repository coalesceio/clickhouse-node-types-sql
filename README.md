## Known limitations

### `Variant` columns in SQL nodes

Coalesce does not infer the `Variant` data type correctly when it reads a SQL node's `SELECT`.
A source column of type `Variant(Array(UInt64), String, UInt64)` is inferred on the downstream
SQL node as `String(Array(UInt64), String, UInt64)`, which is not a valid ClickHouse type, so
the node's create fails with:

```
String data type family mustn't have more than one argument - size in characters
```

The node types do not try to repair the inferred type. Until Coalesce infers `Variant`
correctly, convert the column in the `SELECT` to a type Coalesce understands, for example:

```sql
toString(`c_Variant`) AS `c_Variant`,
```

or leave the column out of the node.
